# Popular Movies
An Android toy app that fetches the latest movie information from The Movie Database servers and presents it to the user through a clean and compelling User Interface. Some of the available features: sorting by Popularity/Rating, support for viewing Trailers and Reviews, maintaining a local collection of Favorite movies.

Popular Movies showcases core Android framework elements such as Recycler Views, Loaders and Content Providers, while using third-party libraries such as Picasso for efficient image loading.

This app was developed as part of my Associate Android Developer Fast Track Scholarship.
